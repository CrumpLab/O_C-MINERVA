Hemisphere Suite: Alternate Alternate Firmware for Ornament and Crime
===

This is a copy of the Hemisphere suite, and I'm trying to learn how to code modules for hemisphere, many thanks to Jason Justian for this codebase!

At the moment I am blogging about learning to code for hemisphere over here <https://crumplab.github.io/blogposts/7_28_20_OC/7_28_20_OC.html>.


### firmware:

Hemisphere Suite is an open-source project by Jason Justian (aka chysn)

ornament**s** & crime**s** is a collaborative project by Patrick Dowling (aka pld), mxmxmx and Tim Churches (aka bennelong.bicyclist) (though mostly by pld and bennelong.bicyclist). it **(considerably) extends** the original firmware for the o_C / ASR eurorack module, designed by mxmxmx.

### hardware:

eurorack / teensy 3.2 DAC8565 quad 16bit CV module w/ OLED display

14HP, depth ~ 25mm
